# Define a custom dataset to load images from a folder
class ImageFolderDataset(Dataset):
    """
    A custom PyTorch dataset class for loading and preprocessing images from a folder.
    
    This class is designed to be used with image data stored in a folder. It loads images, applies
    specified transformations, and returns them as PyTorch tensors.

    Parameters:
    - folder_path (str): The path to the folder containing the image files.
    - shape (tuple, optional): The desired shape for the images (height, width). Default is (224, 224).
    - transform (torchvision.transforms.Compose, optional): A composition of image transformations.
      Default is a set of common transformations, including resizing and normalization.

    Methods:
    - __len__(): Returns the total number of images in the dataset.
    - __getitem__(idx): Loads and preprocesses an image at the given index and returns it as a PyTorch tensor.

    Example Usage:
    ```python
    dataset = ImageFolderDataset(folder_path='/path/to/images', shape=(256, 256), transform=my_transforms)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
    ```

    Note:
    - Ensure that the image files in the specified folder are in common formats (jpg, jpeg, png, gif).
    - The default transform includes resizing the image to the specified shape and normalizing pixel values.
    - You can customize the image preprocessing by passing your own transform as an argument.
    - This dataset class is suitable for tasks like image classification, object detection, and more.

    Dependencies:
    - PyTorch
    - torchvision.transforms.Compose
    - PIL (Python Imaging Library)
